Having an extremely hard time extracting the data in the random function.  Cannot figure out how to retrieve data from a specific page. Can only get a random beer from the first, entries[0] page.  


I have a hunch that I need to map over the data first and put beer ID's into an array, as their order in the database is in constant flux, their position is not a reliable identifier.  
Pretty obvious now, but yeah, I just had an epiphany... lol
